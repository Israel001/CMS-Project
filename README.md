Introduction
CMS, or Content Management System, is a distributed system for managing different types of contents.

CMS has been designed to be general and to handle many different types of contents. Nonetheless, CMS has been explicitly build to be used in different organizations since June 2018 in Vietnam.

Download
For end-users it's best to download the latest stable version of CMS, which can be found already packaged at https://github.com/Israel001/CMS-Project.

This git repository, which contains the development version in its master branch, is intended for developers and everyone interested in contributing or just curious to see how the code works and wanting to hack on it.

Please note that since the sandbox is contained in a git submodule you should append --recursive to the standard git clone command to obtain it. Or, if you have already cloned CMS, simply run the following command from inside the repository:

git submodule update --init
